# LOP_MA-EDM

This repository contains the source code of Memetic Algorithm with Explicit Diversity Management (MA-EDM). This is a population-based optimizer designed for the Linear Ordering Problem. This method has been used to generate several new best-known solutions (BKSs). The information about the BKSs are in the "Supplementary Material - BKS.pdf" file. The description is in arxiv in the document "A Diversity-aware Memetic Algorithm for the Linear Ordering Problem" by LÃ¡zaro Lugo, Carlos Segura and Gara Miranda. The paper has been submitted to the Applied Soft Computing Journal.
